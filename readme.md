### misc
* [`util.h`](util.h) contains some simple c macros for combos, 2-key tap dance, & home-row mods.
* [`build.sh`](build.sh) is an interactive script to build and flash firmware using a local build environment.
* **layout** is near identical to my layout [here (keymapdb)](https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/waffle87), sans a couple things like unicode.
