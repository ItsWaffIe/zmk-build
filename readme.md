### zmk build repository
my [zmk](https://zmk.dev) configuration & keyboard code!

### misc
* [`util.h`](util.h) contains some simple macros for combos, 2-key tap dance, & home-row mods.
* [`build.sh`](build.sh) is a (convolute) script to build and flash firmware.\
coincidentally, my primary zmk keyboards use an identical layout, so the necessary files can be temporarily copied over at build time
* **layout** is near identical to my layout [here (keymapdb)](https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/waffle87), sans a couple things line unicode
